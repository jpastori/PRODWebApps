<!--
    The "refresh" meta-tag's content identifies the number of
    seconds to delay and the location (URL) to load.
    When using the refresh meta-tag you should not specify "0"
    for the delay time because your site's visitor will have
    trouble moving "back" through their browser's history.-->

<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; URL=http://libweb.sdsu.edu/libforms"></head>

<!--    Provide a link that the user can click on just in case
    there is a problem with the meta-refresh redirection method.-->

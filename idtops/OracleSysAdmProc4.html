<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>Procedure 4:  Oracle Development Instance Export <BR>(oradbbkup devapps).</H1></DIV>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oradbbkup script is run on GANDALF.SDSU.EDU as a cron job.  It calls the oracledbbackup Perl program to backup all the data files
of the devapps Oracle instance. It copies the files in the /ora/data/devapps directory to the  /ora/archive/devapps directory.  
<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The *.log and *.ctl files are copied as is.  The *.dbf files are tarred into oracle.tar.  The table data is also exported into a *.dmp file
using the Oracle exp utility program.   All Oracle programs are found in the /oracle/oracle102gserver/bin directory.  The *.dmp files are
named for the instance and date they were created.  Finally, the perl program deletes any *.dmp files older than 7 days.
<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oradbbkup script and the oracledbbackup Perl program are stored in the /oracle/oracle102gserver/dbexports directory.  The oradbbkup script
can be run manually from this directory.
<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To look at or change the timing of the cron job:

<UL>
	<OL>
		<LI>		Start the secure shell (ssh) software to create a telnet style session.</LI><BR>

		<LI>		Login  as user oracle.  (See Barry, Carol, John or Ron for current user account passwords.)</LI><BR>

		<LI>		Change to user root with the su command:  <STRONG><EM>su [return]</EM></STRONG>, Enter root password [return].</LI><BR>

		<LI>		Change to the cron directory by typing: <STRONG><EM>cd /var/spool/cron [return]</EM></STRONG>.</LI><BR>

		<LI>		You can display the contents of the cron file by typing: <STRONG><EM>cat oracle [return]</EM></STRONG>.</LI><BR>

		<LI>		You can change the timing of the cron job by typing: <STRONG><EM>crontab -e -u oracle [return]</EM></STRONG>. 
				The first line that ends in devapps is the line to change.  It says that at 00 minutes, 23 hours (11:00pm) 
				every day of every month, Monday(1) to Friday(5) run the job:  /oracle/oracle102gserver/dbexports/oradbbkup devapps.</LI><BR>

		<LI>		Log out of the secure shell (ssh) software by typing: <STRONG><EM>exit [return]</EM></STRONG> and closing the window.</LI>
